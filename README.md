###What is Udacity Plus?

Good question, Neo. Udacity Plus is a third party userscript that provides extra functionality for the MOOC website Udacity.

###What kind of extra functionality?

Currently it offers an article link at the top of the page where you can read student articles.

It also creates extra buttons on the Udacity forums to allow you to upvote specific questions and answers to nominate them to article status. U+ additionally adds extra tabs at the bottom of lesson videos, providing extra material contributed by U+ users, and a space to write your own notes.

###Requirements:

Firefox with the GreaseMonkey extension, or Chrome with the Tampermonkey extension.
The server uses erlichmen's py-bcrypt ([https://github.com/erlichmen/py-bcrypt][2])

###Home website:
[https://udacityplus.appspot.com][1]

###Planned/potential features:

- (Customisable) quick links at the top of the page. Will probably link to pages in the Udacity Wiki. Examples:
  - Student projects (sites/apps created by Udacians)
  - HOWTOs
  - Articles
  - Hot topics
- Extra tabs for class videos:
  - Discussions
- Integration with other projects
