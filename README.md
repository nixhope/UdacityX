#What is Udacity Plus?

Good question, Neo. Udacity Plus is a third party Grease Monkey userscript plugin that provides extra functionality for the MOOC website Udacity.
This repository includes both the javascript file (tucked away in static/udacityplus.user.js) and the Python server code.

##What kind of extra functionality?

Currently it offers an article link at the top of the page where you can read student articles. This feature will soon be enhanced for greater usability. There's a screenshot hidden away in static/udacity_plus_screenshot.png.

##That's it?

Well, it's the future that's interesting. There will be extra tabs with bonus material for select lecture videos. And hopefully a space to take your own notes. There will also be extra buttons so you can nominate forum posts to be added to the article collection.
