##What is Udacity Plus?

Good question, Neo. Udacity Plus is a third party userscript that provides extra functionality for the MOOC website Udacity.

##What kind of extra functionality?

Currently it offers an article link at the top of the page where you can read student articles. This feature will soon be enhanced for greater usability.

##That's it?

Well, it's the future that's interesting. There will be extra tabs with bonus material for select lecture videos. And hopefully a space to take your own notes. There will also be extra buttons so you can nominate forum posts to be added to the article collection.

##Requirements:

Firefox with the GreaseMonkey extension, or Chrome with the Tampermonkey extension.
